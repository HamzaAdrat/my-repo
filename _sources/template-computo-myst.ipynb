    "# Point process discrimination according to repulsion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "In numerous applications, cloud of points do seem to exhibit *repulsion* in the intuitive sense that there is no local cluster as in a Poisson process. Motivated by data coming from cellular networks, we devise a classification algorithm based on the form of the Voronoi cells. We show that, in the particular set of data we are given, we can retrieve some repulsiveness between antennas, which was expected for engineering reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the performance analysis of cellular systems, the locations of antennas (or base stations) play a major role (see {cite}`BaccelliStochasticGeometryWireless2008`). It is usually admitted that they can be modeled by a Poisson process. But the data which can be gathered from the Web site of the French National Agency of Radio Frequencies, Cartoradio, see {cite}`ANFR`, tend to prove that this may not be the case. More precisely, if we look at the global picture of all antennas in Paris, we see features reminiscent of a Poisson process (local clusters for instance), see {numref}`paris-orange-fig`(left). However, if we look closer and finer, by specifying a region and a frequency band, we see that the antennas locations do seem to exhibit some repulsion (see {numref}`paris-orange-fig`, right picture).\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In previous papers, point processes with repulsion have been used to model such systems {cite}`Deng2014`, {cite}`Miyoshi2016`, {cite}`Gomez2015` for no reason but a mere resemblance between the pictures like the right picture in {numref}`paris-orange-fig` and those obtained by simulating a point process with repulsion. The question is then to decide, given one sample of positions of base stations in a bounded domain, whether it is more likely to be modeled by a point process with repulsion or by a *neutral* point process, i.e. where the locations could be considered as coming from independent drawings of some identically distributed random variables. As we only have a single realization,  we cannot use frequency methods. Since the observation window is finite, we cannot either resort to estimates based on stationarity or ergodicity and  we must take care from the side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale behind our work comes from {cite}`goldman_palm_2010`. It is shown there  that the Voronoi cells of the Ginibre point process (a particular point process with repulsion, see below for the exact definition) are in some sense more regular (closer to a circle) than those of a Poisson process (see {eq}`theorem_goldman` in Theorem 1.). By simulation, this feature seem to persist for other point processes with repulsion, like Gibbs processes. It is this aspect that we use to construct our classification algorithm.\n",
    "We will simulate several configurations (repulsive and non-repulsive) with the same given  number of points $N$. For each configuration, we will compute the Voronoi diagrams and construct two vectors which will represent the input of our algorithm; an area vector containing the areas of the $10$ innermost Voronoi cells in order to avoid edge effects, plus $4$ other average areas from $20$ cells to have more information on the configuration. And a second perimeter vector which is constructed in the same way, containing the squared perimeters of the corresponding Voronoi cells.\n",
    "The choice of areas and square perimeters as aspects to our classification task is based on the *isoperimetric inequality in $\\mathbf{R}^2$ that states, for the length $P$ of a closed curve and the area $A$ of the planar region that it encloses, that\n",
    "```{math}\n",
    ":label: isoperimetric_inequality\n",
    "P^2 \\ge 4 \\pi A\n",
    "```\n",
    "and that equality holds if and only if the curve is a circle. After normalization, we test some classical ML models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, XGBoost) to classify between repulsive and neutral point processes. The results are surprisingly good even though we trained our models only on Ginibre point processes to represent the whole family of point processes with repulsion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper is organized as follows. We first recall the theoretical notions that we will need in the rest of this paper. We will also briefly define the Papangelou intensity which is at the core of the definition of repulsion. In section 3 we show numerically, and based on two Machine Learning classification models, how the locations of antennas in Paris can be considered as repulsive configurations.\n",

    " A configuration on $E=\\mathbf R^2$ is a locally finite (respectively finite) subset of $E$.

We denote by $\\mathcal B(\\mathfrak N)$ the Borelean $\\sigma$-field on $\\mathfrak N$. A locally finite (respectively finite) point process is a random variable with values in $\\mathfrak N$ (respectively $\\mathfrak N_{f}$).\n",

    "\n",
    "The Cartoradio web site contains the locations (in GPS coordinates) and other informations about all the antennas (or base stations) in metropolitan France for any operator, any frequency band and all generation of wireless systems (2G to 5G). The capacity of an antenna depends on its power and on the traffic demand it has to serve.  Outside metropolitan areas, the antennas are relatively scarce and located along the main roads to guarantee a large surface coverage (around 30 km$^2$). Hence there is no need to  construct models for these regions.  On the contrary, in big towns, the density of base stations is much higher to handle the traffic demand: An antenna covers around half a squared kilometer. This is  where the dimensioning problem do appear. One should have a sufficient number of antennas per unit of surface to transport all the traffic, on the other hand, base stations operating in a given frequency band cannot be to close to mitigate interference. This explains the right picture of Figure {numref}`paris-orange-fig`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to assess the type of point process we should consider in this situation, we cannot consider the city as a whole: the geography (notably the Seine river in Paris, the parks, etc.), the non uniformity of demands (the traffic is heavier aroung railway stations or touristic sites,  for instance) which entails a higher density of antennas,  ruin any kind of invariance a statistician  could hope for. That means, we should restrict our expectations to local models of  the size of a district or a bit more. Since interference, which are the main annoyance to be dealt with, are a local phenomenon, working on a partial part of the whole domain is sufficient to predict the behavior and dimension a wireless network. \n",

    "Given a circular domain with $N$ points, we want to decide whether the points suffer from repulsion or not. Since the repulsion is not sensitive to scaling, we normalize the radius to $R=\\sqrt{N}$. This is due to the fact that a cloud drawn from a  Ginibre point process of intensity $1$  with $N$ occupies roughly a disk with this radius. We train our models on datas issued from drawings of Ginibre configuration and from drawings of $N$ points independently and uniformly scattered in $B(0,\\sqrt{N})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the previous samples, we compute the Voronoi diagrams and retain only the $10$ cells which are the closest to the barycenter of the configuration in order to avoid side effects. We then  extract the areas and the perimeters  of these cells. In addition to that, we compute the mean of the first $5$, $10$, $15$ and $20$ cells' areas in order to have a more global information.\n",

    "We can notice that the classification results are mostly positive, which means that the majority of the samples taken from the CARTORADIO data can be decided as repulsive configurations which is consistent with our starting hypothesis. For the configurations whose results were as non-repulsive, we can say that this is due to one of the two following reasons:\n",
    "- As long as we are dealing with real data, these two samples may be a non-repulsive ones and the results are actually coherent.\n",
    "- It is sure that the accuracy of our models is very high, but we may have some classification errors, which means that even if the configuration is repulsive, the model decides that it is not.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this paper it has been shown numerically (based on the theoretical results in {cite}`goldman_palm_2010`) that Voronoi cells represent an effective means for determining the nature of repulsion of a configuration (repulsive or not), and this by creating a database of various configurations and extracting the areas and perimeters of the Voronoi cells in order to use them as input to the classification models described earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the models are trained and tested on the data created, they are tested after that on real data, which are the positions of a mobile phone base stations in PARIS. Visually, we can easily say that these configurations are repulsive, which we have confirmed for the majority of these configurations by testing them by the previously trained models.\n",
